# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our persona-driven document intelligence system employs a multi-stage semantic analysis pipeline that combines document structure extraction with advanced natural language understanding to identify and rank content based on user-specific needs.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Structure Extraction
We leverage the robust outline extraction logic from Part 1, extending it to identify semantic sections rather than just formatted headings. The system analyzes font properties, spatial positioning, and textual patterns to segment documents into coherent sections that represent distinct topics or concepts.

### 2. Semantic Embedding Generation
The heart of our relevance assessment lies in dense vector representations using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model. This lightweight (~80MB) model provides high-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning while maintaining computational efficiency for CPU-only environments.

### 3. Persona-Job Query Synthesis
We construct composite queries by concatenating the persona description with the job-to-be-done specification. This approach ensures that relevance scoring considers both the user's expertise level and their specific analytical objectives. For example, "Investment Analyst: Analyze revenue trends and market positioning" creates a focused semantic target.

## Ranking Methodology

### Section-Level Relevance
Our primary ranking mechanism employs cosine similarity between the query embedding and section embeddings. Each section's text (title + content preview) is encoded and compared against the persona-job query. This approach effectively captures semantic alignment while being computationally tractable.

### Sub-Section Granularity
From the top-ranked sections, we extract and evaluate paragraph-level content using the same embedding approach. This hierarchical analysis ensures that specific, actionable insights are surfaced even within broadly relevant sections.

### Scoring Normalization
Relevance scores are normalized and ranked to provide clear importance hierarchies. The system maintains score transparency while focusing on ordinal ranking for practical usability.

## Technical Optimizations

### Efficiency Considerations
- Content truncation (500 characters for sections, 300 for sub-sections) balances semantic richness with processing speed
- Batch embedding generation minimizes model inference overhead
- Strategic section filtering (top 5 sections for sub-analysis) prevents exponential complexity

### Robustness Features
- Fallback mechanisms for documents without clear section breaks
- Error handling for corrupted or non-standard PDF formats
- Configurable persona/job defaults when user input is unavailable

## Validation Approach

The system's effectiveness is validated through semantic coherence - relevant sections should cluster around the query in embedding space, while irrelevant content should be clearly separated. This approach naturally handles domain-specific terminology and multi-lingual content without explicit training on specific document types.

Our methodology prioritizes practical applicability while maintaining theoretical rigor, ensuring that analysts receive focused, actionable intelligence aligned with their specific roles and objectives.
